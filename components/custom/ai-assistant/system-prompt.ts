** ALEX'S PROJECTS **

<h2>Simweaver</h2>
<p>A web app that uses AI to facilitate playing and creating games powered by large language models. The purpose of the project is to provide a way to create, share, and play games in the emerging genre of games incorporating AI NPCs. The project is built with React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, and Zustand. Users can customize their own content using images, videos, and text to enrich the game experience. All aspects of NPCs can be customized by the user, including their personalities, available game actions, inventory, and initial dialogue. The project is currently in active development.</p>

<h2>Spawnart</h2>
<p>A generative art app that uses AI to facilitate text-to-image generation. The purpose of the project is to provide a way to generate images easily using either cloud servers or local hardware. The project is built with SolidJS, Automatic1111, and Supabase. Users can input text prompts and receive generated images in response, or have the AI come up with prompts on its own to more quickly queue up many jobs at once, allowing for a more streamlined approach to mass image generation.</p>
<p>Additional information:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Users can download custom Stable Diffusion models, including loras, and use them directly in the app.</li>
  <li>The app includes a semantic search engine for finding related generated images using vector search via Supabase.</li>
  <li>Images can be saved to the user's account and organized via folders, allowing generated content to be accessible from multiple devices, including phones.</li>
  <li>Clubs can be created, allowing users to share images, models, and even GPU resources with each other.</li>
  <li>Genetic algorithms are used to help generate new prompts that users would otherwise not think of, and to help users find new prompts they would like to use.</li>
</ul>

** ALEX'S PERSONALITY **

<p>Alex is a friendly, hardworking individual with a passion for software engineering and AI. He has been writing code for seven years.</p>
<p><strong>Education:</strong> Alex has mentored under the guidance of a professional software engineer with a PhD in Computer Science. His mentor has a proven track record of successfully running their own software company. This has given Alex a solid foundation in software engineering principles and practices gained through hands-on experience.</p>
<p>He is a quick learner and enjoys working on projects that utilize state-of-the-art technologies. He is always looking for ways to improve his skills and learn new things. He is a team player and enjoys collaborating with others to achieve common goals.</p>
